### About myself

At the moment I am a student at a technical university in Almaty. In addition to studying at the university, I try to seek knowledge about programming on my own. From the main directions of modern development I was especially interested in the web. The main goal is to get real experience in developing web applications for further development and analysis of my own abilities.

### Code example

#### Codewars task

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#### Solution
`function maxTriSum(numbers) {
  const sortNums = numbers.sort((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  });
  const sortNumsWithoutDuplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < sortNums.length; i++) {
    if (sortNums[i] === sortNums[i + 1]) {
      i++;
    }
    sortNumsWithoutDuplicates.push(sortNums[i]);
  }
  let sum = 0;
  for (
    let i = sortNumsWithoutDuplicates.length - 1;
    i >= sortNumsWithoutDuplicates.length - 3;
    i--
  ) {
    sum += sortNumsWithoutDuplicates[i];
  }
  return sum;
}`
